### Kia ora! 👋🏻

Ko Hugh Lilly tōku ingoa. I am a recent graduate of the [Diploma in Web Development + Design](https://www.whitecliffe.ac.nz/technology/diploma-in-web-development-and-design-l5) (L5) at Whitecliffe College, in Auckland, New Zealand. My [final project](http://tbcc.onrender.com) was a full-stack web app, using [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), [Render](https://www.render.com) and [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix). Previous projects included [a simple Javascript to-do app](https://hughlilly.github.io/study/) ([source]([https://github.com/hughlilly/study](https://github.com/hughlilly/study/blob/main/Q3/JS/Practical/InteractiveWebApp/js/script.js))), and two iterations of a website for a cinema company: [one in HTML, CSS, and Javascript](https://github.com/hughlilly/tongarirocinemas), and the [same site re-created using React](https://tongarirocinemas-react.vercel.app) ([source](https://github.com/hughlilly/tongarirocinemas-react)).

I have a BA (Hons) from Auckland University, and in 2021 attained the [NZ Certificate in Tikanga (Mātauranga Māori)) (L3)](https://www.twoa.ac.nz/nga-akoranga-our-programmes/study-from-home/certificate-in-tikanga-maori) from Te Wānanga o Aotearoa. Prior to commencing the Whitecliffe diploma, I worked in the Research Library at [Auckland War Memorial Museum Tāmaki Paenga Hira](http://aucklandmuseum.com) for a decade, most recently as Systems Librarian.
